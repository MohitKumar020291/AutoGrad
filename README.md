# AutoGrad  
Starting this project so I can use it in [____](https://github.com/MohitKumar020291/Classifying-Names-with-a-Character-Level-RNN), the development of autograd might stop at a certain level cause I am just implementing what is required - like I currently  
- have a neuron which holds a class `Value` - yeah you are getting it right  
- a neuron may be manipulated : like a basic neuron starts with a value of 0 - then we adds the weight product feature, and repeats for all rest of the weights
- a neuron is generally used in the next layer

Future
- A linear layer backprop
- Complete these articles : they are inspiration
  - Implementing triton
